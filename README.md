# mcidle-rs ðŸ¦€

A port of mcidle to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Currently a work in progress.

# To-do

- [ ] Mojang Auth
- [ ] Encryption
- [ ] Setup thread safe client listener/pool
- [x] Compression
- [x] Packet wrapper
- [x] Read/send 
- [x] Serialization of primitives
- [x] Coverage support
- [ ] Multiple protocols (codec?)
- [ ] Refactoring libs into crates
- [ ] Continuous integration

Lots more I'm probably missing.
