# mcidle-rs

Yet another port of mcidle âœ¨, but this time to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Supported Minecraft versions
| Version        | Protocol     |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 1.12.2        | 340           |

### Compiling
To compile, make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) then run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qubard/mcidle-rs
cd mcidle-rs
cargo build --release
```

The executable will be located in `target/release`.

### Are we functional?
Not yet.
