- move bytebuf logic into its own file in serialize i think
- more tests specific to bytebuffer??
- interface implementation for bytebuffer/trait so we can swap out different implementations of it
- other packets
- encryption/decryption
- compression
- logging
- protocol support

in rust you can combine/inherit traits (interfaces) so you can make it as generic as possible without referring
explicitly to a struct to just let others implement those interfaces and then your containers or whatever type
behavior will be implicitly supported
